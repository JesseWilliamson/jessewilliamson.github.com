        <h1>You Need To Learn JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Here's the thing, if you claim to be a web developer, you need to know JavaScript. Real JavaScript. There was a time, not long ago, that we didn't write JavaScript; we wrote <a href="http://jquery.com/" title="jQuery" target="_blank">jQuery</a>. That time is gone. The game has changed. I'm shouldn't be telling you anything you don't know.</p>
<p>JavaScript is ubiquitous. You simply cannot remain relevant on the web without knowing actual, real JavaScript. You don't need to know <a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Node JS" target="_blank">Node</a>. You don't need to know <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" title="CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a>. You don't need to know <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="Backbone JS" target="_blank">Backbone</a>, or <a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember JS" target="_blank">Ember</a>, or <a href="http://angularjs.org/" title="Angular JS" target="_blank">Angular</a>, or <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" title="Knockout JS" target="_blank">Knockout</a>, or whatever new MV* library comes out tomorrow. You don't need to grow a curly mustache, ride a fixed gear, listen to Skrillex, and learn VIM. You don't need to become an expert, but you can't ignore it or relegate it to simple DOM manipulation (which is, arguably, the worst part of the language).</p>
<p>The problem, at least in the .NET world, is this: JavaScript is looked at like a second class citizen. Many, not all, of us have already tossed JavaScript aside. We've decided that things like Ajax Helpers, Web Methods and Script Methods are a better option. Should we need anything more, we'll add in some jQuery and call it a day. After all JavaScript is an ugly little language not fit for our keystrokes. We've added layers of abstraction to keep ourselves safe from the JavaScript Oger. Why write JavaScript when I can just write a Web/Script method in C#, or use an HTML Helper? Why indeed.</p>
<p>JavaScript is awesome when you know how to use it. Spend some time with it. I was floored when I started to learn what actual, real JavaScript development could be like. I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>I'm no expert, not by a long-shot. But I'm am significantly better than I was a little as 4 weeks ago, and that's just from reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361551984&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=javascript+the+good+parts" title="The Good Parts" target="_blank">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>. That's less than 150 pages of book. That's a weekend (week if you're me*). That's insane. Even if you go no further in your JavaScript studies, you'll be leaps and bounds beyond where you are today.</p>
<p>The age of JavaScript isn't coming, it's here. You will need to know it, or you will be left behind.</p>
